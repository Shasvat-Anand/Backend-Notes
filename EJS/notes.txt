# Lecture 1 what is templating

Template is blueprint of the html page that having being using so many time in our website.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
EJS is a simple templating language that lets your generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

1- create directory for the EJS
2- inside ejs directory use (npm init -y ) it set package.json file default
3- install express using (npm install express)
4- install ejs by using commnand (npm install ejs)

after that require express and run your server


#Lecture 2  Using EJS

ejs is package we do not need to require it because express require ejs by default

so we are going to use directly 


app.set("view engine","ejs")

it says we are going to use ejs templete for the website 

for response we are going to use
 res.render("filename.ejs")

 res.render render the whole file to server 
 when we use this render with filename express search that file into a views folder in that directory and then render that file .

if we want to run index.js of ejs dir. from root directory we are doing so.

go to the root dir. and run this commnand

nodemon EJS/index.js

it run that file but it give an error when we render files from views because it search views dir into the root directory


### Lecture -3  view directory

so resolve this we are going to use path package

const path = require("path")

app.set("views",path.join(__dirname,"/views")) from this line we define the exect path of views

it mean when search "views" go the __dirname -- it give the current working dir of index.js which is currently running and join that with "/views"

this total give us a correct dir of views -- filename


### Lecture 4 Interpolation Syntax

Interpolation refer to embedding expressions into marked up text
